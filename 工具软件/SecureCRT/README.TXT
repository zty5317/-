Product Overview
----------------

SecureCRT protects your passwords, user accounts, and data,
combining rock-solid terminal emulation with the strong
encryption, broad authentication options, and data integrity
of the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol.

SecureCRT provides versatile solutions for a wide range of
business, network management, information security, and
development tasks, from accessing host-based applications and
administering servers to securely accessing behind-the-firewall
network resources like e-mail, files, and printers.

SecureCRT features a multi-session tabbed interface with
extensive session management and customization features.
Customization options include toolbars, menus, keymaps, and
login scripts, as well as fonts, cursors, and color schemes. 

Named sessions and firewalls let you create individual
configurations that can be used on a session-specific basis.
Other features include the Activator tray utility to minimize
desktop clutter, auto logon, printing, Emacs mode, and SOCKS
firewall support.

Choose from a wide range of emulations including VT100, VT102,
VT220, ANSI, SCO ANSI, Wyse 50/60, Xterm, and Linux console -–
all with ANSI color.  Multibyte character sets are supported
for Japanese, Korean, and Chinese, as is support for scalable
line-drawing fonts.

SecureCRT supports SSH1, SSH2, Telnet, RLogin, Serial, and TAPI
protocols and authentication via password, public key, X.509
certificate, and Kerberos v5 via GSSAPI.  Ciphers include AES,
3DES, RC4, Blowfish, and Twofish.

Powerful scripting capabilities, including ActiveX scripting
support for VBScript and other scripting languages, save you
valuable time by automating routine configuration tasks.  Secure
file transfers can be performed using the bundled VCP or VSFTP
command-line utilities or Zmodem within SecureCRT.  SSH2
connections can also be made from the command line using the
included VSH program. 

SecureCRT and the SecureFX(R) file transfer client can be
integrated, letting you share global and session options and the
host key database so configuring a server connection only needs
to be done once.

SecureCRT includes a 30-day try-before-you-buy evaluation license
for the fully functional application and access to VanDyke
Software technical support.

1. New For SecureCRT 5.1
------------------------

The major new features for SecureCRT 5.1 are:

  FIPS 140-2 support.
    SecureCRT now has an administrator option to run in "FIPS Mode".
    When this option is set, SecureCRT uses a FIPS 140-2 validated
    cryptographic library and only allow FIPS approved algorithms.

  Enhanced support for X.509 certificate authentication.
    X.509 certificate forwarding is now supported directly
    as well as through a CAPI store.  SecureCRT also supports
    forwarding through the public-key agent, which means that
    re-authentication is not necessary when connecting to
    another machine using the same X.509 certificate.

  Activator support for SSH agent functionality.
    If Activator is running, re-authentication is not required
    for SSH sessions after closing SecureCRT.

  Tab-related enhancements.
    After selecting a folder or multiple sessions in the Connect
    dialog, launch them in tabs with a single click.  Also added a
    global option to only show tabs when there are more than one.

  Chat window history.
    Previous commands can be viewed, edited, and sent in the chat
    window.

By default, SecureCRT 5.0 stores all settings and sessions in:

  "C:\Documents and Settings\<Username>\Application Data
    \VanDyke\Config"

If a version of SecureCRT older than 5.0 was installed, your settings
and sessions will need to be migrated, which will move them to a new

new location the first time you run SecureCRT 5.1.
