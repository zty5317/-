Changes in SecureCRT 5.1.2 (Official) -- May 25, 2006
-----------------------------------------------------

Bug fixes:

  - Line drawing did not work correctly for SCO ANSI emulation.
  - When the default session was edited and a tab other than the first
    tab was active, the "Apply change to all sessions?" prompt was
    displayed even if no changes were made.
  - Under certain circumstances, the color change sequence for
    256-color Xterm emulation was split between buffers, which caused
    some colors to be displayed incorrectly.
  - SSH2: SecureCRT could crash when using the TAB key to complete a
    filename in an SFTP tab, especially if TAB was pressed multiple
    times.


Changes in SecureCRT 5.1.1 (Official) -- April 25, 2006
-------------------------------------------------------

Changes:

  - For new installations, the default local directory for SFTP tabs
    is now "My Documents".  The SFTP local directory can be set
    through a session INI-file only option called "Sftp Tab Local
    Directory".

Bug fixes:

  - There were problems with line drawing characters and menu
    positions when running dellmgr.
  - On 64-bit systems, pressing "8" brought SecureCRT to the
    foreground.
  - In some cases, when the SecureCRT window was maximized, the
    arrow control was placed in the tab bar even though it was
    not necessary.
  - SSH2: Under certain circumstances, SecureCRT crashed when
    attempting to start an X client using SSH2 X11 forwarding.
  - SSH2: The trailing slash was no longer being appended during
    local file completion.  This was a change in behavior from 5.0.
  - SSH2: It was not possible to change the passphrase of a public
    key through the Public Key Properties dialog.
  - SSH2: When initiating an SSH2 password change from the Password
    Properties dialog and multiple authentications were selected,
    misleading errors were displayed.


Changes in SecureCRT 5.1 (Official) -- March 28, 2006
-----------------------------------------------------

Bug fixes:

  - In some cases, escape sequences beginning with "ESC ]" were
    incorrectly interpreted.


Changes in SecureCRT 5.1 (Beta 4) -- March 14, 2006
---------------------------------------------------

Changes:

  - Added Global.ini option "Serialize Connections".  If this
    option is set, when multiple sessions are connected at the
    same time, they are connected serially instead of in parallel.
  - VCP/VSH: The command-line clients now display unsupported
    host-key algorithms as they are received from the server.
    Previously unsupported algorithms were displayed as blank
    strings.
  - VCP/VSH: Entering the wrong passphrase for an SSH1 RSA public
    key no longer displays an "invalid structure" error.  Users are
    now prompted to enter a passphrase until they use the correct
    one or cancel.

Bug fixes:

  - If a generic proxy was misconfigured, it caused SecureCRT to
    hang, and disconnecting the session caused SecureCRT to crash.
  - SecureCRT crashed when unsaving a password for a session and
    password that had been specified on the command line.
  - The tab status indicator changed to "connected" when connecting
    to a host that did not exist if another tab that was connected
    was selected before the connection attempt timed out.
  - SSH2: When editing the default session, it was possible do a
    password change.
  - SSH2: Under certain circumstances, even though an X.509 host key
    had been accepted and saved, SecureCRT asked about accepting it
    during key re-exchange or when reconnecting.


Changes in SecureCRT 5.1 (Beta 3) -- March 2, 2006
--------------------------------------------------

Changes:

  - The installation program no longer removes old versions of
    SecureCRT from Windows Add/Remove Programs.
  - For DNS addresses, SecureCRT uses the return list as is,
    rather than preferring IPv4 addresses.

Bug fixes:

  - If SecureCRT and SecureFX were integrated, but were out of
    sync, it was possible for the authentication method and key
    exchange lists to be empty on the SSH2 page in the Session
    Options dialog.
  - After installing SecureCRT for the first time, upon starting,
    the user was prompted to configure TAPI information and
    SecureCRT crashed if the dialog was cancelled.
  - Under certain circumstances, printing did not work after
    upgrading from a version of SecureCRT prior to 5.0.
  - If a log file name with parameter substitutions was specified
    and "Prompt for filename" was set, the log file name was not
    honored.
  - In the Quick Connect dialog, changes made to the default
    session were only reflected for the default protocol.
  - The transfer protocol name was modified in the session .ini
    file every time a connection attempt to that session was made.
  - SSH1: Under certain circumstances, authentication failed when
    connecting to an SSH1 server using Quick Connect.
  - SSH1: Entering the wrong passphrase for an SSH1 RSA public key
    resulted in an "invalid structure" error.
  - SSH2: In the Local Port Forwarding Properties dialog, it was
    not possible to use the same local port as another port forward
    when the local IP address was different.


Changes in SecureCRT 5.1 (Beta 2) -- February 21, 2006
------------------------------------------------------

New features:

  - Added history support to the chat window, allowing previous
    commands to be viewed, edited, and sent.
  - SSH2: Passwords for SSH2 sessions can be changed from the
    Session Options dialog using the SSH2 protocol when it is
    supported by the remote machine.

Changes:

  - Added a global-file-only option "Clipboard Data Format",
    which allows the clipboard data format to be set to CF_TEXT,
    CF_OEMTEXT, or CF_UNICODETEXT.
  - When "FIPS mode" is enabled, invalid cryptographic algorithms
    are not displayed in the Session Options dialog. 
  - When "FIPS Mode" is enabled, it is displayed in the About box.
  - SSH2: Added default support for X.509 certificate server host
    keys.
  - SSH2: When a key exchange method is not supported, a message
    is logged to the trace output.
  - SSH1/SSH2: Authentication methods can be edited in the Session
    Options dialog for SSH1 and SSH2 sessions that are connected.

Bug fixes:

  - When SecureCRT and SecureFX were integrated and the terminal
    protocol for a session was set to SSH2 and the transfer
    protocol was set to FTP, if the password was saved, it had to
    be re-entered when switching between SecureCRT and SecureFX.
  - Paste sometimes used Unicode, even though ASCII text was
    selected.
  - When multiple sessions were connected and the "Always on Top"
    setting was changed, the setting did not always have the
    correct value when a different session was active.
  - After installing SecureCRT and running it for the first time,
    if the evaluation dialog was quit, the next time SecureCRT
    was run, it tried to migrate unnecessarily.
  - SSH2: Pressing OK in the GSSAPI Properties dialog caused
    SecureCRT to crash 
  - SSH2: SecureCRT did not honor the SFTP Tab Local directory
    setting. 
  - SSH2: When "FIPS Mode" was enabled, the New Host Key dialog
    did not display the server's fingerprint.  It is now displayed
    as a SHA-1 hash when "FIPS Mode" is enabled. 
  - SSH1: Under certain circumstances, SSH1 host keys could not
    be saved.


Changes in SecureCRT 5.1 (Beta 1) -- January 31, 2006
-----------------------------------------------------

New features:

  - Enhanced support for X.509 certificate authentication.
    - Previously, X.509 was supported through a CAPI store.  Now,
      X.509 certificates are also supported directly. 
    - SecureCRT supports forwarding X.509 certificates through the
      public-key agent. This means that authentication happens
      automatically when connecting to another machine using the same
      X.509 certificate.
  - SecureCRT now has an administrator option to run in "FIPS Mode".
    When this option is set, SecureCRT uses a FIPS 140-2 validated
    cryptographic library and only allows FIPS-approved algorithms.
  - The Activator supports SSH agent functionality, which means that
    if SecureCRT is closed, authentication happens automatically as
    long as the Activator is still running.
  - Folders and multiple selected sessions can be connected from the
    Connect dialog.
  - Global option to only show tabs where there are more than one.    
  - Custom menu/toolbar command OPEN_SESSION_TAB to open a session 
    in a tab. 
  - Support for ActiveX scripts written in Unicode or UTF-8.
  - Script support for sending and waiting for Unicode strings.
  - SecureCRT can run a script by interpreting the special escape
    sequence "script <script>".
  - Added a Logging property to the Session scripting object that
    allows a script to determine if logging is enabled.
  - Support for execute escape sequences in Wyse 50 emulation.
  - SSH2: Added a session option not to request a shell upon
    connection.  

Changes:

  - View menu items such as Chat Window and Status Bar can now be
    shown and hidden when a tab other than the first tab is active. 
  - Large pastes can be cancelled by typing CTRL+C.
  - SecureCRT remembers the last log file that was specified in the
    Select Log File dialog.
  - If a tab is renamed, the new name is remembered until a different
    session is opened in that tab or until SecureCRT is closed.
  - Added a session option to ignore window title change requests that
    are received from the remote system.
  - Added a menu item to the Edit menu that allows focus to change
    between the active session and the chat window.  The keyboard
    accelerator ALT+G can also be used.  Also, CTRL+SHIFT+TAB can be
    used in the chat window to switch to the active session.
  - The text "<Send chat to all tabs>" is displayed in the chat window
    when the "Send chat to all tabs" option is set.
  - Added support for 8-bit characters in the title bar.
  - The left margin can be as large as 1024 pixels wide.
  - Hidden files and folders are not displayed in the Connect dialog.
  - In addition to being able to put the script header at the top of
    a script, the script engine can be read from the registry or can
    be overridden using an NTFS alternate data stream to contain the
    script header if the header would interfere with the script.
  - Script file lines can now be terminated with a single line feed
    (LF) in addition to carriage return line feed (CRLF).
  - Added Global.ini option "Suppress Execute Escape Sequence Exit
    Codes" that suppresses the "S" and "F" escape sequence return
    codes.
  - SSH2: Modified the SSH2 page in the Session Options dialog to
    allow key exchange methods to be configured. 
  - VSH: Improved error message for the case where /NOPROMPT was
    specified on the command line and a prompt was needed.
  - VSFTP: "/" can be used to list the roots when connecting to a
    server that allows multiple roots, such as VShell.

Bug fixes:

  - When a tab was closed, the associated session's settings were
    saved when "Auto Save Options" was not set.
  - When multiple tabbed sessions were disconnected and automatically
    reconnected, logging did not resume.
  - ANSI color changes were not being used after the screen was
    reset. 
  - SecureCRT failed to connect through a SOCKS version 5 proxy
    without authentication because of a DNS failure. 
  - Running a script that did an Xmodem transfer caused SecureCRT to
    hang.
  - The title bar was not updated correctly when substitution
    parameters were used.
  - Multi-line tab titles caused the tab title to wrap. 
  - If the session option "Clear on Disconnect" was set when a session
    was disconnected, the active tab was cleared, which was not always
    the disconnected tab.
  - Under certain circumstances involving tabbed sessions and
    scrolling, it was possible to get in a state where opening a
    remote file using "vi" displayed session scrollback rather than
    the file being edited.
  - Typing characters from languages such as Chinese or Japanese into
    a session did not work correctly.
  - Pasting UTF-8 characters into a session did not work correctly.
  - The horizontal scrollbar was not the correct width when a session
    had the "retain size and font" option set and the window was
    resized to be smaller than the number of columns.
  - If a shortcut key was set for a SecureCRT shortcut, the shortcut
    key started SecureCRT, but it did not switch to SecureCRT.
  - If a key was mapped to \v\r, the carriage return was incorrectly
    sent as soon as 80 characters were pasted.
  - In a dual monitor configuration, SecureCRT sometimes did not start
    in the correct location when the specified position was a negative
    value.
  - Telnet: If a Telnet session to localhost was disconnected when
    Microsoft IIS server was running, it caused the explorer window
    manager to exit.
  - Serial: SecureCRT crashed when connecting to the same serial
    port using a session that had the "Auto reconnect" option enabled.
  - SSH1: SecureCRT crashed when generating an SSH1 RSA key that was
    larger than 1800 bits.
  - SSH1/SSH2: Switching protocols from SSH1 to SSH2 caused an
    extra X11 page to be displayed in the Session Options dialog.
  - SSH2: SecureCRT crashed if an SFTP session was exited and the
    session option "Close on disconnect" was set.
  - SSH2: SecureCRT crashed when login failed and a remote port
    forward needed to do a hostname lookup. 
  - SSH2: SecureCRT crashed when attempting to upload a newly
    generated public key using the Public Key Assistant if the
    session was not connected. 
  - SSH2: After issuing an "exit" command in an SFTP tab, the tab
    could not be closed using CTRL+F4.
  - SSH2: On the SSH2 page in the Session Options dialog, if no key
    exchange method was selected, the dialog informing that at least
    one key exchange method must be selected was displayed twice.
  - SSH2: Some Kerberos key exchange methods were listed twice in the
    key-exchange methods list.
  - SSH2: If a password was typed before the password prompt appeared,
    it was displayed in the session window after the session was
    connected.
  - SSH2: After connecting to OpenSSH running on a Cyclades TS2000
    console server, the session could not be disconnected.
  - VSFTP: No error message was displayed if the remote side
    disconnected.
  - VSH: VSH hung if a pipe was full and VSH sent more data to that
    pipe.
  - VSH: The Current User's profile was not being used to load and
    save host key information.
